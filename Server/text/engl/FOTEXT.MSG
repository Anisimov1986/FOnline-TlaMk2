{3184}{}{McClure, let's drop this hypocrisy, we're alone here. You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.}

{3300}{}{Doc Johnson on air. Calling my colleagues…}
{3301}{}{Colleagues online, brother. Peace, Painless. Long time no hear.}
{3302}{}{Troy, is it you, you underground douchebag? Still sitting in that vault like some kind of a mole?}
{3303}{}{Who are you calling a douchebag? I invented goddamn jet antidote! And all you know is how to treat your miners' arthritis.}
{3304}{}{Just listen to him. I did this, I invented that. You couldn't even set up its production, I had to do it for you…}
{3305}{}{Here it comes again… Whenever these two start it…}
{3306}{}{Hey, Holliday, how have you been?}
{3307}{}{Not bad. Healing mutants, treating ghouls. Is Jubilee here? I don't hear him!}
{3308}{}{Yes, I'm here, I'm here. Hello everyone.}
{3309}{}{Hey Jub. Fellas, do you remember how Jubilee was looking for appendix on the left duiring internship?  He got his arm in that poor guy up to his elbow…}
{3310}{}{Oh, come on. It only happened that one time. And I was drunk, so it doesn't count.}
{3311}{}{Whatever. A nice palace you got yourself, sitting in NCR, enjoying the comforts of democracy…}
{3312}{}{You should see these comforts! A while ago that Chosen One almost had me crawling on my belly, saying I stole a map of vault 13 from some miner. I barely got off. I still shudder when I remember about it.}
{3313}{}{You got what was coming to ya, he-he…}
{3314}{}{All right, enough, guys. Listen Johnson, I hear you had an epidemic of syphilis. Did you cope with it?}
{3315}{}{Yeh. Had a hard time doing it, to tell you the truth. None of the residents paid any attention to preliminary symptoms, the illiterate fucks they are. And when they did, half of the town was already infected. I had to go around like a dumbass asking who did who for the last month. But in the end I figured out who was the source. Damn you for reminding me.}
{3316}{}{Well done.}
{3317}{}{Agreed. Good job, Johnson.}
{3318}{}{Oh, Doctor Fung! My compliments!}
{3319}{}{Greetings, teacher!}
{3320}{}{Glad to hear you.}
{3321}{}{Hello boys. Glad to hear you all too. I'm happy we have a chance to stay in touch and ask each other for advice now. You all became good specialists.}
{3322}{}{Thank you, teacher…}
{3323}{}{Don't interrupt me! I'm not finished. I think it's time for you to think about taking apprentices. Knowledge must not be lost. I know Troy already took care of that. What about the rest of you?}
{3324}{}{Of course, teacher.}
{3325}{}{I will.}
{3326}{}{That didn't cross my mind till now…}
{3327}{}{Sorry, boys, I have to leave you now. I have a patient bitten by sharks. We'll get in touch next week.}
{3328}{}{Yes, teacher.}
{3329}{}{So long.}
{3330}{}{Stay healthy.}
{3331}{}{Hmm... You know what, guys? How about we all have a drink now?}
{3332}{}{Eh?}
{3333}{}{Great idea.}
{3334}{}{Wait, I only got spirit. Got to go to the bar to grab some booze, be right back. Don't start without me.}
{3335}{}{All right, all right. We all get back online in half an hour. No excuses. And by the way, let's think of a backup channel, err…}
{3336}{}{How about the year of discovery of penicillin.}
{3337}{}{That will do.}
{3338}{}{All right, I'm out.}
{3339}{}{Yeah.}
{3340}{}{Go on.}

{8000}{}{Who are you?}
{8001}{}{Programmer, here to restore your authorization system on AHS-7 request.}
{8002}{}{Brother Honomer? You're expected. And who's that with you?}

{8011}{}{Who are those visitors today?}
{8012}{}{A programmer to repair authorization system.}
{8013}{}{Why do we need another programmer? Where's our idler?}
{8014}{}{Oh, you don't know? He was shot...}
{8015}{}{Why?!}
{8016}{}{An inspection headed by AHS-7 paid us a visit. Boss was showing them around the lab.}
{8017}{}{So, they're going round, meeting the personnel. And then they pop into the server room.}
{8018}{}{So?}
{8019}{}{So. Our programmer is sleeping on the server drunk as a skunk. Music's playing loud... A total mess. The boss turned red as he's seen that.}
{8020}{}{Total screwup...}
{8021}{}{Yeah. AHS-7 reprimanded the boss. So he called the guys from the surface, they put our programmer against the wall and fired a burst at him. By God, how he screamed...}
{8022}{}{So what now?}
{8023}{}{He'll be back when they replicate him. There's no one else boss could hire. And for now this coder from Frisco will repair our dead authorization system.}
{8024}{}{I see... But how do we get in or out without the authorization system?}
{8025}{}{We just get in or out, that's it. No password whatsoever.}
{8026}{}{But that's dangerous.}
{8027}{}{Yeah. But this guy looks like he knows what he's doing.}
{8028}{}{Oh...}

{8029}{}{What's this... "define true=false".  Coment: "Good luck debugging this, bitch". Nice.}
{8029}{}{Where are these shit coders coming from?}
{8029}{}{Hmm, maybe it will work this way... FUCK! It didn't...}
{8029}{}{There's a month load of work here...}
